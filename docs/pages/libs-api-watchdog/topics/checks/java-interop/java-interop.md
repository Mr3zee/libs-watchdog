# Java interop checks

%product% includes six checks that keep a JVM library ergonomic for Java consumers. They flag
shapes that compile fine but that Java callers cannot use idiomatically, or cannot use at all. All
six only run in JVM compilations.

## The checks

- [Mangled JVM names in public API](mangled-jvm-name-public-api.md) - a value class in a
  signature makes the JVM backend mangle the compiled name, so Java cannot call it.
- [Kotlin-only API without JvmSynthetic](kotlin-only-api-without-jvm-synthetic.md) - `suspend`
  functions, reified generics, and Kotlin-specific function types stay visible to Java even
  though Java cannot call them idiomatically.
- [Companion API without JvmStatic](companion-api-without-jvm-static.md) - companion object
  functions compile to instance methods, so Java has to reach them through `Outer.Companion`.
- [Companion constants without JvmField](companion-constant-without-jvm-field.md) - constant-shaped
  companion properties are only reachable from Java through the companion instance getter.
- [Top-level API without JvmName](top-level-api-without-jvm-name.md) - a file's public top-level
  declarations compile into a facade class named after the file, so renaming the file breaks Java
  callers.
- [Default parameters without JvmOverloads](default-parameters-without-jvm-overloads.md) - default
  parameter values are a Kotlin-only feature; without `@JvmOverloads` Java callers must specify
  every argument.

## Kotlin-only audience

These checks only pay off for libraries that support Java consumers. A library with a Kotlin-only
audience turns off the whole group instead of demoting each check individually:

```kotlin
apiWatchdog {
    javaInterop {
        enabled = false
    }
}
```

The `enabled` switch wins over the per-check severities configured inside the same `javaInterop { }`
block: once it is `false`, none of the six diagnostics run, no matter what their individual
severity properties are set to. See the [Gradle plugin reference](gradle-plugin.md) for the full
list of severity properties.

## Per-declaration exceptions

A library that generally supports Java can still let individual declarations sacrifice Java
ergonomics on purpose - for example, a coroutine-based API with no blocking bridge planned.
Acknowledge that in place with the matching `@Intentionally*` exemption annotation for the check,
using the `IGNORE_JAVA_INTEROP` reason and a description of why this declaration ignores Java
callers:

```kotlin
@IntentionallyKotlinOnlyApi(
    reason = ExemptionReason.IGNORE_JAVA_INTEROP,
    description = "Coroutine-only API, no blocking or CompletableFuture bridge planned.",
)
public suspend fun refresh(): String = fetchLatest()
```

`IGNORE_JAVA_INTEROP` only categorizes the exemption; the description still has to spell out the
reason. See [Exemptions and internal API](exemptions.md) for the full exemption model, including
`EXEMPTION_WITHOUT_EXPLANATION`, which rejects a bare exemption.
