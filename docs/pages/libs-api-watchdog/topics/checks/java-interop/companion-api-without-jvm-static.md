# Companion API without JvmStatic

`COMPANION_API_WITHOUT_JVM_STATIC` reports public companion object functions that compile to an
instance method on the nested `Companion` class instead of a static entry point on the outer
class.

## What it reports

Flags a public (or `@PublishedApi`) function declared directly in a companion object - of a class
or an interface - that carries neither `@JvmStatic` nor `@JvmSynthetic`. Without `@JvmStatic`,
Java callers can only reach the member through the companion instance:

```kotlin
public class Registry {
    public companion object {
        // COMPANION_API_WITHOUT_JVM_STATIC
        public fun create(): Registry = Registry()
    }
}
```

## Rationale

A companion function without `@JvmStatic` compiles only as an instance method on the generated
`Companion` class, so Java code must spell out `Outer.Companion.member(...)` for what looks, from
Kotlin, like a plain static factory or utility - an unidiomatic and easy-to-miss call shape.
`@JvmStatic` additionally compiles a static `Outer.member(...)` entry point for Java, without
changing how Kotlin resolves the same call. See the Kotlin guide on
[static methods](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/java-to-kotlin-interop.html#static-methods).

## Don't

```kotlin
public class Registry {
    public companion object {
        public fun create(): Registry = Registry()
    }
}
```

## Do

```kotlin
public class Registry {
    public companion object {
        @JvmStatic
        public fun create(): Registry = Registry()
    }
}
```

Notable edge cases and deliberate exceptions:

- `@JvmSynthetic` members are hidden from Java on purpose and are not flagged.
- `suspend` companion functions are exempt here - they are not Java-callable regardless of
  placement, and `KOTLIN_ONLY_API_WITHOUT_JVM_SYNTHETIC` reports them with the fitting fix.
- Overrides are not flagged: their Java-facing shape is fixed by the overridden declaration, and
  `@JvmStatic` cannot be applied to an override anyway.
- Interface companions compile the same way and are checked identically to class companions.
- Internal functions are skipped unless marked `@PublishedApi`.

## When to exempt

Apply `@IntentionallyNonStaticCompanionApi` on the function itself, or on a containing class - the
companion object or its outer class - where it covers every member inside:

```kotlin
public class Acknowledged {
    public companion object {
        @IntentionallyNonStaticCompanionApi(reason = ExemptionReason.API_DESIGN)
        public fun create(): Acknowledged = Acknowledged()
    }
}
```

The same annotation also acknowledges `COMPANION_CONSTANT_WITHOUT_JVM_FIELD`, so a class- or
companion-level placement covers both checks for every member inside at once.

## Configuration

The property lives inside the `javaInterop { }` block:

```kotlin
apiWatchdog {
    javaInterop {
        companionApiWithoutJvmStatic = WatchdogSeverity.WARNING
    }
}
```

With direct compiler invocation:
```
-P plugin:org.jetbrains.kotlinx.libs.api.watchdog:diagnosticSeverity=COMPANION_API_WITHOUT_JVM_STATIC:warning
```

Turn off the whole Java interop group at once with `javaInterop { enabled = false }`; see
[Java interop checks](java-interop.md).
