# Open API without subclass opt-in

`OPEN_API_WITHOUT_SUBCLASS_OPT_IN` reports public open or abstract classes and interfaces that
can be subclassed outside the library without any restriction.

| Exemption | [`@IntentionallyOpen`](exemptions.md) |

## What it reports

A public `open`/`abstract` class with at least one public or protected constructor, or a public
non-sealed interface, lets any external caller subclass it. Every such subclass constrains how
the declaration can evolve later, so the checker flags the declaration unless subclassing is
gated or acknowledged:

```kotlin
// OPEN_API_WITHOUT_SUBCLASS_OPT_IN
public open class Widget
```

If the class has no public primary constructor, the diagnostic is anchored on each accessible
(public or protected) constructor instead of on the class declaration, since those constructors
are what actually opens it to subclassing.

## Rationale

Once external code subclasses a type, the library can no longer freely add abstract members,
change existing members' signatures, or tighten invariants without breaking those subclasses.
Unrestricted open API is one of the classic ways a
[public declaration becomes hard to evolve](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/api-guidelines-predictability.html#prevent-unwanted-and-invalid-extensions):
every unreviewed subclass is an implicit contract the author never agreed to.

## Don't

```kotlin
// OPEN_API_WITHOUT_SUBCLASS_OPT_IN
public open class Widget

// OPEN_API_WITHOUT_SUBCLASS_OPT_IN
public interface Plugin {
    public fun run()
}
```

## Do

```kotlin
public open class Widget internal constructor()

@RequiresOptIn
public annotation class InternalMyLibrarySubclassApi

@SubclassOptInRequired(InternalMyLibrarySubclassApi::class)
public interface Plugin {
    public fun run()
}
```

`@SubclassOptInRequired` marks the api as internal to opt-in for, preventing unexpected breaking changes.  

## Edge cases

- A `@SubclassOptInRequired` annotation with no marker classes gates nothing; it is reported by
  the separate [`SUBCLASS_OPT_IN_WITHOUT_MARKERS`](subclass-opt-in-without-markers.md) check
  instead of this one.
- A class whose constructors are all `internal` or `private` cannot be subclassed outside the
  library, so it is never reported, even if it is `open` or `abstract`.
- `fun interface`s are checked like any other interface.
- Sealed interfaces are exempt here; they are covered by
  [`EXHAUSTIVE_PUBLIC_API`](exhaustive-public-api.md) instead.

## When to exempt

When unrestricted subclassing is an intended, stable part of the contract, acknowledge it
instead of adding an opt-in marker:

```kotlin
@IntentionallyOpen(reason = ExemptionReason.API_DESIGN)
public open class Widget
```

`@IntentionallyOpen` targets the class declaration only.

## Configuration

```kotlin
libsApiWatchdog {
    openApiWithoutSubclassOptIn.set(WatchdogSeverity.WARNING)
}
```

With direct compiler invocation:
```
-P plugin:org.jetbrains.kotlinx.libs.api.watchdog:diagnosticSeverity=OPEN_API_WITHOUT_SUBCLASS_OPT_IN:warning
```
