# Data classes in public API

`DATA_CLASS_PUBLIC_API` reports public data classes, whose generated members expose their
constructor property list as part of the compiled API.

| | |
|---|---|
| Diagnostic | `DATA_CLASS_PUBLIC_API` |
| Default severity | Error |
| Gradle property | [`dataClassPublicApi`](gradle-plugin.md) |
| Exemption | [`@IntentionallyDataClass`](exemptions.md) |

## What it reports

Any `data class` reachable from the public API - top-level, nested inside another public class,
or `internal` but marked `@PublishedApi` - is flagged, regardless of nesting depth:

```kotlin
// DATA_CLASS_PUBLIC_API
public data class Coordinates(public val x: Int, public val y: Int)
```

## Rationale

A `data class` generates `copy`, `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString`, and one `componentN` function
per constructor property, all shaped by the exact property list and its order. Adding, removing,
or reordering a property later changes the signatures of `copy` and the `componentN` functions,
which breaks source and binary compatibility for callers who use named-argument `copy`,
destructuring declarations, or positional construction. See the Kotlin library authors' guide on
[avoiding data classes in your API](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/api-guidelines-backward-compatibility.html#avoid-using-data-classes-in-your-api).

## Don't

```kotlin
// Adding a `z` property later changes copy() and destructuring - a breaking change.
// 
// DATA_CLASS_PUBLIC_API
public data class Coordinates(public val x: Int, public val y: Int)
```

## Do

```kotlin
public class Coordinates(
    public val x: Int,
    public val y: Int,
) {
    override fun equals(other: Any?): Boolean =
        other is Coordinates && x == other.x && y == other.y

    override fun hashCode(): Int = 31 * x + y

    override fun toString(): String = "Coordinates(x=$x, y=$y)"
}
```

Notable cases:

- `data object`s are exempt: with no constructor properties, none of `copy`, `componentN`, or a
  per-instance constructor is generated.
- Plain `internal` or `private` data classes are not part of the public API and are not reported.
- An `internal` data class annotated `@PublishedApi` is still reported, since it belongs to the
  published binary API.

## When to exempt

Apply `@IntentionallyDataClass` to the class declaration when the property list is a deliberate,
stable part of the contract:

```kotlin
@IntentionallyDataClass(reason = ExemptionReason.API_DESIGN)
public data class MarkedData(public val x: Int)
```

The annotation targets the class declaration only; there is no parameter- or type-level placement.

## Configuration

```kotlin
apiWatchdog {
    dataClassPublicApi = WatchdogSeverity.WARNING
}
```

With direct compiler invocation:
```
-P plugin:org.jetbrains.kotlinx.libs.api.watchdog:diagnosticSeverity=DATA_CLASS_PUBLIC_API:warning
```
