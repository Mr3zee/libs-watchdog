`UNDOCUMENTED_PUBLIC_API` reports public declarations that have no KDoc.

## What it reports

Every publicly visible declaration a client can reference - classes, interfaces, objects, enum
classes, annotation classes, type aliases, functions, properties, secondary constructors, and enum
entries - is flagged when it carries no KDoc. Only the presence of a KDoc is checked, not its
content:

```kotlin
// UNDOCUMENTED_PUBLIC_API
public class Cache
```

## Rationale

A KDoc is the contract a client can rely on. Without one, callers can only guess intent from the
implementation, and any later change - even a bug fix - risks breaking a usage nobody wrote down as
supported. Writing the contract down first is what lets the library author change the
implementation later without guessing what clients depend on. See the
[Kotlin API guidelines on documenting your API](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/api-guidelines-informative-documentation.html#thoroughly-document-your-api).

## Don't

```kotlin
// UNDOCUMENTED_PUBLIC_API
public class Cache {
    // UNDOCUMENTED_PUBLIC_API
    public fun get(key: String): String? = store[key]
  
    private val store: MutableMap<String, String> = mutableMapOf()
}
```

## Do

```kotlin
/** An in-memory string cache keyed by an opaque key. */
public class Cache {
    /** Returns the cached value for [key], or null when nothing is cached under it. */
    public fun get(key: String): String? = store[key]

    private val store: MutableMap<String, String> = mutableMapOf()
}
```

A class KDoc alone does not document its constructor properties; each one still needs a matching
`@property` tag (or `@param` for a `val`/`var` declared in the primary constructor):

```kotlin
/** A user profile. */
public class Profile(
    // UNDOCUMENTED_PUBLIC_API
    public val name: String,
    // UNDOCUMENTED_PUBLIC_API
    public val age: Int,
) 
```

```kotlin
/**
 * A user profile.
 *
 * @property name the user's display name.
 * @property age the user's age in years.
 */
public class Profile(
  public val name: String, 
  public val age: Int,
)
```

Notable exceptions the checker applies on its own, so no annotation is needed:

- Overrides and `actual` declarations inherit the KDoc of the declaration they implement.
- Compiler-generated members (data class `copy`/`componentN`, enum `values`/`valueOf`/`entries`)
  have no source of their own and are never reported.
- A plain `//` or `/* */` comment does not count; only a KDoc block (`/** ... */`) satisfies the
  check.

## When to exempt

Apply `@IntentionallyUndocumented` directly on the class, type alias, function, property,
constructor, or enum entry that stays undocumented; it does not cover nested or member
declarations:

```kotlin
@IntentionallyUndocumented(description = "Self-explanatory one-line getter.")
public fun currentTimestamp(): Long = System.currentTimeMillis()
```

## Configuration

```kotlin
libsApiWatchdog {
    undocumentedPublicApi.set(WatchdogSeverity.WARNING)
}
```

With direct compiler invocation:
```
-P plugin:org.jetbrains.kotlinx.libs.api.watchdog:diagnosticSeverity=UNDOCUMENTED_PUBLIC_API:warning
```
