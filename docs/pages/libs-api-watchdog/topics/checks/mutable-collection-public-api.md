## What it reports

Flags return types, property types, value parameter types, and type parameter bounds that mention
a mutable collection type: any of the `kotlin.collections` mutable interfaces (`MutableList`,
`MutableSet`, `MutableMap`, `MutableCollection`, `MutableIterable`, `MutableIterator`,
`MutableListIterator`, `MutableMap.MutableEntry`), a classifier implementing one of them
(`ArrayList`, a hand-written `MutableList` subtype, ...), or an array. Type arguments are checked
too, so a mutable type nested in an otherwise read-only container still counts:

```kotlin
// MUTABLE_COLLECTION_PUBLIC_API
public fun produce(): MutableList<String> = mutableListOf()

// MUTABLE_COLLECTION_PUBLIC_API
public fun nested(): List<MutableList<Int>> = emptyList()
```

## Rationale

A mutable return type or property lets clients mutate state they do not own; a mutable parameter
lets the library mutate an argument the client still holds. Either way, once mutable state crosses
the API boundary it is unclear whose mutations are safe, and the library can no longer swap its
internal representation for a different collection type without risking a behavioral change for
clients that relied on mutating the exposed instance. See the Kotlin guide on
[avoiding exposing mutable state](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/api-guidelines-predictability.html#avoid-exposing-mutable-state).

## Don't

```kotlin
// MUTABLE_COLLECTION_PUBLIC_API
public class Holder(public val items: MutableList<Int>)
```

## Do

```kotlin
public class Holder(items: List<Int>) {
    public val items: List<Int> = items.toList()
}
```

## Don't

```kotlin
// MUTABLE_COLLECTION_PUBLIC_API
public fun consume(items: MutableSet<Int>): Unit = items.clear()
```

## Do

```kotlin
public fun consume(items: Set<Int>): Unit = Unit // copy internally before mutating, if needed
```

Notable edge cases and deliberate exceptions:

- `vararg` parameters are not flagged themselves - the compiler already passes a defensive copy of
  the array - but a mutable element type still is (`vararg groups: MutableList<Int>`).
- Extension receivers are not flagged: an extension on a mutable collection serves values the
  client already holds, unlike a builder lambda receiver, which is flagged.
- Overrides are not flagged: their signature is fixed by the overridden declaration and reported
  there instead.
- Java platform types are not flagged: their mutability is not declared in Kotlin sources, so only
  the read-only upper bound is inspected.
- A type alias resolves to its expansion, and a mutable bound on a type parameter
  (`<T : MutableList<Int>>`) is flagged the same as a direct mention of the bound.

## When to exempt

Use `@IntentionallyMutableCollection` when sharing the mutable state is a deliberate part of the
API contract. It applies on the whole declaration (function, property, or constructor - covering
the whole signature), on a single parameter or type parameter, or on a type usage, where it covers
the annotated type and everything nested in it:

```kotlin
@IntentionallyMutableCollection(reason = ExemptionReason.API_DESIGN)
public fun sharedRegistry(): MutableList<String> = mutableListOf()

public fun fill(
    @IntentionallyMutableCollection(reason = ExemptionReason.API_DESIGN) target: MutableList<Int>,
): Unit = target.add(1)

public fun snapshots(): List<@IntentionallyMutableCollection(reason = ExemptionReason.API_DESIGN) MutableList<Int>> =
    emptyList()
```

For a `val`/`var` primary constructor parameter, put the annotation on the parameter - the
default use-site target - not on the property it generates; it still covers the property.

## Configuration

```kotlin
libsApiWatchdog {
    mutableCollectionPublicApi.set(WatchdogSeverity.WARNING)
}
```

With direct compiler invocation:
```
-P plugin:org.jetbrains.kotlinx.libs.api.watchdog:diagnosticSeverity=MUTABLE_COLLECTION_PUBLIC_API:warning
```
