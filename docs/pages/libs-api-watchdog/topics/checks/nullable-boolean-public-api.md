# Nullable Booleans in public API

`NULLABLE_BOOLEAN_PUBLIC_API` reports `Boolean?` in publicly visible signatures.

|---|---|
| Diagnostic | `NULLABLE_BOOLEAN_PUBLIC_API` |
| Default severity | Error |
| Gradle property | [`nullableBooleanPublicApi`](gradle-plugin.md) |
| Exemption | [`@IntentionallyNullableBoolean`](exemptions.md) |

## What it reports

Flags return types, property types, parameter types (constructors included), and type parameter
bounds that mention `Boolean?`, type arguments included, so a nullable Boolean hidden inside a
`List<Boolean?>` or behind a type alias is caught too:

```kotlin
// NULLABLE_BOOLEAN_PUBLIC_API
public fun probe(): Boolean? = null
```

## Rationale

`Boolean?` models three states but names only two of them: `true`, `false`, and an unnamed third
state that every caller has to remember stands for something, whether that is "unknown", "not yet
decided", or "not applicable". Because the third state has no name, callers reach for a
two-branch `if` where the real logic needs three branches, and the meaning of `null` can only be
learned from documentation. See the Kotlin library authors' guide on
[avoiding the Boolean type as an argument](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/api-guidelines-readability.html#avoid-using-the-boolean-type-as-an-argument).

## Don't

```kotlin
// true, false, or... what does null mean here?
//
// NULLABLE_BOOLEAN_PUBLIC_API
public fun connectionState(): Boolean? = null
```

## Do

```kotlin
public enum class ConnectionState { CONNECTED, DISCONNECTED, UNKNOWN }

public fun connectionState(): ConnectionState = ConnectionState.UNKNOWN
```

## Don't {id="dont-2"}

```kotlin
// NULLABLE_BOOLEAN_PUBLIC_API
public class Holder(public val checked: Boolean?)
```

## Do {id="do-2"}

```kotlin
public enum class CheckState { CHECKED, UNCHECKED, UNKNOWN }

public class Holder(public val checked: CheckState)
```

Notable edge cases and deliberate exceptions:

- Unlike `BOOLEAN_PARAMETER_PUBLIC_API`, constructors are checked too: a stored three-state flag
  is as opaque to its readers as a passed one.
- A type alias resolves to its expansion, and a `Boolean?` bound on a type parameter
  (`<T : Boolean?>`) is flagged the same as a direct mention.
- A `vararg` parameter needs no special casing: the array carrying the arguments is never a
  nullable Boolean itself, and a `Boolean?` element type is still found as its type argument.
- Extension receivers are not flagged: an extension on `Boolean?`, typically a remedial helper
  like `fun Boolean?.orFalse()`, serves values the client already holds.
- Overrides are not flagged: their signature is fixed by the overridden declaration and reported
  there instead.
- Java platform types are not flagged: their nullability is not declared in Kotlin sources.

## When to exempt

Use `@IntentionallyNullableBoolean` when the nullable Boolean is a deliberate part of the API
contract. It applies on the whole declaration (function, property, or constructor, covering the
whole signature), on a single parameter or type parameter, or on a type usage, where it covers the
annotated type and everything nested in it:

```kotlin
@IntentionallyNullableBoolean(reason = ExemptionReason.API_DESIGN)
public fun legacyProbe(): Boolean? = null

public fun acknowledgedParameter(@IntentionallyNullableBoolean(reason = ExemptionReason.API_DESIGN) flag: Boolean?) {}

public fun snapshots(): List<@IntentionallyNullableBoolean(reason = ExemptionReason.API_DESIGN) Boolean?> = emptyList()
```

For a `val`/`var` primary constructor parameter, put the annotation on the parameter, the default
use-site target, not on the property it generates; it still covers the property.

## Configuration

```kotlin
apiWatchdog {
    nullableBooleanPublicApi = WatchdogSeverity.WARNING
}
```

With direct compiler invocation:
```
-P plugin:org.jetbrains.kotlinx.libs.api.watchdog:diagnosticSeverity=NULLABLE_BOOLEAN_PUBLIC_API:warning
```
