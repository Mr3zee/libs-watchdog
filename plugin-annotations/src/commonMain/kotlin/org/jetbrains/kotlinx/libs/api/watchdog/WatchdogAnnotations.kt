/**
 * Acknowledges that the annotated DSL marker deliberately keeps a wrong target set - no-op
 * targets in its `@Target`, or no explicit `@Target` at all - because fixing it would break
 * existing clients.
 *
 * The libs-api-watchdog compiler plugin warns about
 * [DSL marker](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html#scope-control-dslmarker)
 * targets on which the marker has no effect. For an already-published marker the fix is
 * breaking: removing a target rejects client
 * code that applies the marker there, and declaring an explicit `@Target` forbids the previously
 * allowed default targets. Apply this annotation to suppress the warnings for such legacy
 * markers.
 *
 * Wrong marker targets are never good API design, so unlike the other exemptions this one bakes
 * its only accepted reason - backwards compatibility - into its name and carries no
 * [ExemptionReason]. New DSL markers must declare effective targets instead.
 *
 * See the check documentation for rationale and examples:
 * [no-op targets](https://mr3zee.github.io/libs-api-watchdog/dsl-marker-noop-target.html),
 * [missing explicit targets](https://mr3zee.github.io/libs-api-watchdog/dsl-marker-without-explicit-targets.html).

/**
 * Turns the annotated annotation class into an internal API marker: declarations annotated with
 * the marked annotation, and everything nested in them, are exempt from all public API checks.
 *
 * Libraries sometimes expose declarations that are public for technical reasons but are not part
 * of the supported API surface, and flag them with a dedicated annotation (usually one that also
 * requires opt-in). Such declarations carry no compatibility contract, so the libs-api-watchdog
 * compiler plugin should not demand documentation or evolution safeguards for them:
 *
 * ```
 * @InternalAnnotationMarker
 * @RequiresOptIn(level = RequiresOptIn.Level.ERROR)
 * public annotation class InternalMyLibraryApi
 *
 * @InternalMyLibraryApi // Not watched: internal API despite the public visibility.
 * public class ReflectionHelper
 * ```
 *
 * The marker annotation class itself remains part of the public API surface and is still watched.
 *
 * See [Exemptions and internal API](https://mr3zee.github.io/libs-api-watchdog/exemptions.html) for details.
